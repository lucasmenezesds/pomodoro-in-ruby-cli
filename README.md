# PiRb-CLI

Pomodoro in Ruby - CLI version

TODO

## Installation

`bundle install`

#### Ubuntu Based

If you're using Ubuntu based distro you'll need to install `libgtk2.0-dev` in order to run the project

#### Other OS

Due the usage of the gem FFI you'll probably have a problem this missing files `libgobject-2.0.so`, so you'll need to
install the respective library that will provide it. Probably installing a `gtk` lib should be enough to run the project

TODO

## Usage

`bin/pomodoro`

or

`ruby bin/pomodoro`

TODO

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can
also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
